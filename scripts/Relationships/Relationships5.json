    "text": "Welcome, Alex. This is our planned final session. I'd like to use our time today to reflect on where we started, what you've accomplished, and solidify the path forward. How are you feeling coming in today?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "A mix of things. Proud, I think. And nervous. Like I'm graduating but the real test is out there without the weekly safety net."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "That's a very honest and understandable feeling. The weekly container has been important. Let's start by looking back. When you first came in, the primary pain was a heavy depression that felt tied to a cycle of conflict and withdrawal with Sam. The core thought was 'I am a burden.' Can you describe where that belief stands for you now?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "It's... quieter. It's not gone. When I'm tired or stressed, it still whispers. But I don't always believe it like I used to. Now I have another voice—the one we built here—that says, 'That's the old blueprint talking. That's the depression talking. It's not the whole truth.' I can see it as a thought, not a fact."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "That is fundamental change, Alex. You've developed the observer self. That's the cornerstone of everything else. What about the cycle itself—the pursue-withdraw dance?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "We've interrupted it. Not perfectly, but we have tools. The 'I'm flooding' signal was a game-changer. I talked to Sam about it after our last session. They were... surprisingly receptive. We even have a hand signal for when words are too hard. Last week, I used it during a tense talk about visiting family. I took my ten minutes, splashed water on my face, and came back. We actually finished the conversation. It didn't spiral."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "That is a profound victory. You moved from being a prisoner of the cycle to becoming its manager. You translated an internal crisis ('I need to escape') into a relational request ('I need a pause'). That's the work of secure attachment in action. How has this impacted the depression?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "The fog isn't as constant. The episodes feel less... catastrophic? Before, a conflict would send me into a days-long tailspin of shame. Now, even if we argue, the recovery is faster. Because I don't always attach the meaning that I'm fundamentally broken. Sometimes, it's just an argument. That difference is everything."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "You've disentangled your self-worth from the conflict. That's huge. You mentioned the 'old blueprint'—the lessons from your dad about showing need being weak. How is your relationship with that part of your history now?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "I feel more sadness for that kid now than anger at myself. I understand he had to disappear to be safe. But I'm not that kid anymore, and Sam isn't my dad. My adult job is to protect that kid's wounds, not let them run the show. Sometimes I literally say, 'I've got this,' to myself when I feel him getting scared."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "That is the essence of healing: integrating the past with compassion so it no longer hijacks the present. You're reparenting yourself in those moments. Looking at the full arc of our work, what would you say is the most important skill or insight you're taking with you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "The map. I have a map now. Before, I was just lost in a painful forest with no idea why I kept ending up in the same place. Now, I can see the landmarks: 'There's the trigger. There's the old thought. There's the flood warning. That path leads to the old cycle, this path leads to the time-out.' I have choices. I'm not just reacting."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "A perfect metaphor. And with a map, even if you take a wrong turn, you can re-orient. So, what does maintenance look like for you? How will you keep this map updated and in use?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "I'll keep practicing the noticing. Sam and I have agreed to a monthly 'check-in'—not a heavy relationship talk, just a quick 'how are we doing on the tools' conversation. And I've started a simple journal, just a few sentences, to track the fog and the triggers. Not to obsess, but to stay aware."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "That sounds like a thoughtful, sustainable plan. It focuses on awareness and partnership, not on perfection. As we conclude, I want to acknowledge the courage it took for you to do this work. You faced painful patterns, scary vulnerabilities, and deep-seated beliefs. You've transformed from someone who felt passively trapped by depression and conflict into someone who actively manages their inner world and their relationship."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "I couldn't have done it without this space. Thank you for not just giving me advice, but for giving me the tools to find my own way. I feel... capable. Not fixed, but capable."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "'Capable' is a powerful word. It speaks to agency and resilience. My door is always open for a tune-up session if you hit unfamiliar terrain down the road, but I have every confidence in your capability. Our work together is complete. How would you like to mark this ending?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "Just... with thanks. And knowing it's okay to be proud of this. I am."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "relationships5",

    "speaker": "client",
