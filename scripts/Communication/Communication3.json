    "text": "Hi. It was a mixed week. The articulation practice was fine—I did it most days. The buffer phrase... I tried to bring it up with my partner, but I froze. Again. The exact thing I wanted to talk about preventing, happened when I tried to talk *about* it."

    "text": "First, thank you for your honesty. That is not a failure; it's incredibly valuable data. It tells us the anticipation of a 'big talk' is itself a trigger. This is very common. So let's adjust our approach. Instead of a formal 'we need to talk,' we can use a written or text-based alternative communication method to start the conversation."

    "conversation_id": "communication3",
    "speaker": "client",

    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "Yes. AAC—Augmentative and Alternative Communication—isn't just for non-verbal individuals. It's for anyone who needs a bridge. A text could say, 'Hey, I'm learning a tool in therapy for when I freeze up. Can I share it with you when we have a quiet moment?' It sets the stage without the in-the-moment pressure."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "communication3",

    "text": "That feels like a workaround, but a helpful one. I just want to be able to say things out loud."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "communication3",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "It is a workaround, and that's its strength. Think of it as scaffolding while we build the permanent structure. Using it reduces the anxiety, which in turn makes it more likely you *can* have the verbal conversation later. The goal is effective connection, not suffering through speech. Shall we craft a sample message together?"

    "text": "Alright. Let's keep it low-pressure, collaborative, and positive. Something like: 'I wanted to share something from my therapy that could help us communicate better. I'm practicing asking for a brief pause if I get overwhelmed in conversation, so I can collect my thoughts. It would mean a lot if you'd be open to trying that with me. No rush, we can talk whenever you're free.' How does that land?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "communication3",
    "speaker": "client",

    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "Exactly. Framing it as a collaborative 'us' tool is key. Now, let's shift to practicing the buffer itself in a low-stakes way. Since the in-the-moment freeze is the target, let's try a role-play. I'll be your partner, we're discussing what to make for dinner, and I'll gently disagree with your suggestion. Your only job is to notice the first hint of tension and use your phrase: 'Give me a moment to collect my thoughts.' Ready?"

  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "communication3",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "That is a textbook example of effective communication! You acknowledged my feeling, stated your own, and offered a compromise. The buffer phrase gave you the space to move from a reactive freeze to a responsive solution. How did it feel to use it in the role-play?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "communication3",

    "text": "That's a brilliant way to describe it—pausing the anxiety, not yourself. That's the core of this skill. Now, for this week, your practice is three-fold: First, send that text if it still feels right. Second, practice the buffer phrase in your mind three times a day—just rehearse saying it. And third, during your articulation drill, add one simple sentence, spoken slowly and clearly, like 'I am practicing clear speech.' To bridge the drill to real speech."
