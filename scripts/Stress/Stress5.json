    "text": "Welcome. Today is our planned final session. I thought we could use our time to reflect on the work you've done, consolidate the tools you're taking with you, and look ahead. How does that sound?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "It sounds good. A little surreal. I was thinking on the way here about how I felt in that first session—just completely wound up and reactive. It feels different now."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "I'm glad to hear it feels different. Can you put words to that difference?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "It's like I have a map now. Before, I was just lost in the stress. Now, when I feel the tightness or the panic rising, I recognize the territory. 'Oh, here's the physical alarm.' 'There's The Worth Auditor starting its script.' I have a choice. I don't always make the *best* choice, but I'm not on autopilot anymore."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "That is the essence of building coping skills: moving from autopilot to conscious choice. You've named it perfectly. Having the map doesn't make the territory easy, but it means you're not lost. Let's review that map together. What are the core components of your toolkit?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "Okay. First, the body check and the breath. That's my direct line to calming my nervous system. Even three breaths create a pause. Second, is the cognitive piece: spotting the 'hot thought' and either doing the detective work or, more often now, just naming it—'Ah, the Auditor is here'—which takes its power away. Third, are the behavioral pieces: intentionally seeking 'Moments of Enough' and protecting social connection as maintenance, not reward."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "A comprehensive and integrated summary. You've moved from theory to practice. What has been the most significant shift in your understanding?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "Understanding that the stress wasn't just about having too much work. It was about the *meaning* I attached to the work—that my value was on the line with every task. Separating my worth from my performance has been... liberating. It's a work in progress, but the seed is planted."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "That's the profound shift. You changed the underlying equation. Stressors become challenges to manage, not existential threats. This is sustainable change. Now, looking ahead, what do you anticipate might be your biggest challenge in maintaining this progress?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "Complacency, maybe. When things are going well, I might stop practicing the breathing or the naming. Then a big crisis will hit, and I'll be out of practice. Or, just the slow creep of old habits."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "Very realistic. Think of these tools like a language. If you don't use them, you get rusty. Can we brainstorm a simple, minimal 'maintenance plan'? Something so easy you can do it even when you feel you don't need it."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "Maybe just one anchored practice? Like keeping the 'breathing after the first email' habit. And a weekly check-in with myself—maybe on Sunday evening—to ask, 'How was The Worth Auditor this week? Did I get any Moments of Enough?'"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "That's an excellent, low-effort, high-impact plan. The daily anchor and the weekly reflective check-in. It keeps you engaged with the map. And remember, setbacks are not failure; they are data. If you find yourself feeling 'lost' again, you now know the steps: Pause. Breathe. Name the story. Choose a tiny action that aligns with your worth as a human, not a performer."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "That's a good mantra. 'Pause. Breathe. Name. Choose.'"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "There's your four-step emergency and maintenance protocol. You've done exceptional work. You came in seeking relief from symptoms and engaged in the deeper work of understanding and changing the patterns that created them. How do you feel about ending our formal sessions?"
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "I feel ready. And grateful. This space helped me build an internal space. I know the work continues, but I have the tools and the understanding. It feels like a graduation."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "I love that—building an internal space. That's exactly what you've done. You are now the primary therapist for your own stress. My role was to provide guidance and support while you built that capacity. Remember, the door is always open if you need a 'tune-up' in the future. But I have every confidence in your ability to navigate this."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "client",
    "text": "Thank you. For the guidance, and for the confidence."
  },
  {
    "conversation_id": "stress5",
    "speaker": "therapist",
    "text": "You earned it. Go well. Remember your map, your mantra, and your inherent worth that exists outside of any audit. I wish you all the best."
